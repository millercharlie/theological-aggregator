#### _Solomon is a Christian resource aggregator where trustworthy, accessible, and reliable resources are gathered together in one convenient, accessible platform._

## A Background

There are many phenomenal resources for Christians looking to answer their theological questions, deepen their faith and knowledge of Scripture, and defend their beliefs.

However, discovering such resources can be a chore. There are a few problems with the current discovery process:

#### 1. Reliance on Word-of-Mouth

- Many Christians rely on mentors or trustworthy friends/family to find resources. This process can be inefficient, while access to such reliable peers may not be an option for others.

#### 2. Difficult to Search

- Oftentimes, finding good resources for a particular topic requires knowing exactly how to query your search.

#### 3. Trustworthiness

- It is difficult to know if a resource is trustworthy by a simple search. Oftentimes, deeper research is needed to verify and validate resources.

## The Solution

With all this, I am designing and developing Solomon, which is an aggregator that aims to solve the pain-points listed above. Users are able to sign in and see personalized recommendations for resources, while guests can use the site to discover new resources.

## Technologies

This project is being developed primarily with TypeScript and React, using Emotion for styled Components and Vite as the preferred build tool.
